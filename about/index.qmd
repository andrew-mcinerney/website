::: {#hero-heading}

I'm a Ph.D. student with the [SFI Centre for Research Training in Foundations of Data Science](https://www.data-science.ie/) based in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Limerick.
My current research is centred on a statistical-modelling approach to neural networks, with a particular focus on model selection, uncertainty quantification, and interpretation.
This work is supervised by [Kevin Burke](https://www.kevinburke.ie).
