## Description

This package implements the model selection approach detailed in McInerney
and Burke (2022): "A Statistically-Based Approach to Feedforward Neural Network
Model Selection".
The preprint of this paper is available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.04248).
More specifically, the algorithm alternates between selecting the hidden layer 
complexity and the inputs with the objective of minimizing the BIC.
The neural network function used is `nnet`, which is available from the R
package of the same name (Ripley and Venables, 2022).
